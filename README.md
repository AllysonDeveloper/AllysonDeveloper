- 👋 Hi, I’m @AllysonDeveloper
-     After six year in a seminar I've learned to love the life as a God's gift. I can sum up my philosophy in that way: I'm a Catholic Christian and how a Christ follower I'm called to contribute in the construction of His Kingdom. I know, maybe you are asking whats that information matter in a profile like this one, and I'll awnser you now: because we participate on this construction with all of our-self, with the soul, the spirit and the hands, coding and building solutions that can turn our brothers life better. So for me development is more than a job or career, is my mission.
    
- 👀 I’m interested in theology, philosophy, literature (specially the classics and fantasy), mathematics, phisics and obviously, technology and all that are related with system computers.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End development, to be more specific: HTML, CSS and JS.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front-End projects.
